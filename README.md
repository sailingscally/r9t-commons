# Common Functionality

Before you know it, you have a `sleep()` method scattered across most of your modules, how did this happen,
you ask yourself. This isn't your first software project, you know it will happen if you don't get organised.

This Node.JS module is meant to solve this and other problems. It is the place for common functionality and
shared resources across all R nineT navigation tower microservices / modules.

## Enumerations

- `WeatherAlert` - contains all possible weather alerts generated by the
[r9t-storm](https://github.com/sailingscally/r9t-storm) microservice, each represented by a binary value so
they can be combined (ex: storm with strong wind, rain and wind, etc.)
```JavaScript
const WeatherAlert = {
  NONE:                0b00000000,
  POOR:                0b00000001,
  RAIN:                0b00000010,
  WIND:                0b00000100,
  STRONG_WIND:         0b00001000,
  GALE:                0b00010000,
  STORM:               0b00100000,
  FIRESTORM:           0b01000000,
  SEVERE_THUNDERSTORM: 0b10000000
}
```

## Methods

- `sleep(ms)` - causes the code to sleep for the specified number of milliseconds

## Usage

This module isn't published to the NPM registry and needs to be installed from GitHub with the command:
